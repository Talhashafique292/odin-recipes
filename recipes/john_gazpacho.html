    <p class="third">When we asked our team of editors what they'd be making this month, we all agreed we'd be celebrating tomatoes.</p>
    <p class="third">what better way than in gazpacho? Some prefer the blended Spanish version, while others love that this recipe from Chef John is a mix of blended and chopped produce. Either way, this chilled, no-cook soup combines all the flavors of summer into one bountiful bowl.</p>
