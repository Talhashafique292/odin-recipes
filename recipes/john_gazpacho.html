    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When we asked our team of editors what they'd be making this month, we all agreed we'd be celebrating tomatoes.</p>
    <p>what better way than in gazpacho? Some prefer the blended Spanish version, while others love that this recipe from Chef John is a mix of blended and chopped produce. Either way, this chilled, no-cook soup combines all the flavors of summer into one bountiful bowl.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tomatoes: Tomatoes are the main ingredient in gazpacho. You’ll need four large tomatoes and a pint of cherry tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Other produce: Other ingredients you’ll need from the produce section include English cucumbers, green onions, a jalapeño, a lime, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
    <li>Seasonings: This Spanish gazpacho recipe is seasoned with salt, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Oil: Olive oil ensures a rich, smooth, velvety finished product. </li>
    <li>Sauces: You’ll also need Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar.</li>
</ul>   

<h2>Steps to Follow</h2> 

<ol>
    <li>Combine and puree the ingredients according to the detailed recipe.</li>
    <li>Cover and chill the soup for at least two hours to allow the flavors to meld. </li>
    <li>Top the gazpacho with fresh basil for serving. </li>
</ol>
