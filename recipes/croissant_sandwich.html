    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large croissants, split</li>
        <li>6 slices deli ham (such as Boar’s Head)</li>
        <li>(3/4 ounce) slices Havarti cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>1 cup loosely packed baby arugula</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps to Follow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place bottom of each croissant, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Layer 3 of the ham slices and 2 of the Havarti slices over each croissant bottom.</li>
        <li>Whisk together olive oil, Dijon, and honey in a small mixing bowl until fully combined. Evenly brush top half of each croissant with about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil mixture. Place top of each croissant, cut side down, on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until Havarti is melted and ham is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toss arugula and remaining olive oil mixture in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Remove croissants from oven. Top melted Havarti layer evenly with dressed arugula and croissant tops. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
