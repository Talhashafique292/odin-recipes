    <ol class="myul">
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place bottom of each croissant, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Layer 3 of the ham slices and 2 of the Havarti slices over each croissant bottom.</li>
        <li>Whisk together olive oil, Dijon, and honey in a small mixing bowl until fully combined. Evenly brush top half of each croissant with about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil mixture. Place top of each croissant, cut side down, on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toss arugula and remaining olive oil mixture in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Remove croissants from oven. Top melted Havarti layer evenly with dressed arugula and croissant tops. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until Havarti is melted and ham is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
